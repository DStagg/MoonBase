Moon Base Defence
----------------
2D Platformer where a lone space marine fights off hordes of robots trying to blow up the research base.
----------------
The player plays as a space marine. They have basic 2D platforming movement (walk, jump, crouch) and can shoot a gun (up, down, left, right, diagonal).
They are defending a research base on a moon. Robots of varying types will spawn in waves and attempt to destroy a target object in the base.
If the player kills all of the robots they win. If the target object is destroyed they lose.
The player can switch weapons, regain health, use terrain/equipment and buy upgrades/supplies between waves.
